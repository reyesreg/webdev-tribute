                                Asking Carlo about who he considers to be his hero proved to be difficult, as
                                he couldn't really choose only one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "My heroes are my mom and my dad," he proudly says.

                                From an early age, Carlo recognized the hard work and effort his parents had to go
                                through for the sake of the family. Even in the face of adversary and hardships, they
                                always remained a strong foundation for support and love.
                                Because of the sacrifices they have made, Carlo always strives to make his parents proud
                                through his studies, his career, and his music.

                        <p>
                            Carlo is the second child among three siblings, all of whom are currently
                            in University in their corresponding courses. The eldest, a sister, is
                            graduating in a few months and aspires to become a nurse. The youngest,
                            also a sister, is currently studying in Universiry of Santo Tomas. And of course,
                            Carlo is studying in DLS-CSB, taking up Information Systems.

                        <p>
                            Hearing about him and his siblings all being in University at the same time, I
                            couldn't help but feel at awe how his parents manage their financials, especially when
                            tuition fees nowadays are at an all-time high. I commented on how difficult it must
                            be for his parents to support all of them at the same time. "They're hard-working,"
                            he replied with a smile.

                                Not everything in this life comes cheap or easy, and Carlo's mom is a living
                                testament to that fact. "She left when I was younger and I haven't seen her in about
                                seven years."
                            </p>

                                Joanne Estrada is an Overseas Filipino Worker. She 49 years old, and has been a medical
                                assistant in the States for over seven years. She regularly sends money to her family for
                                support. Although they haven't physically seen each other in a very long time, Carlo 
                                and his mom regularly speak over Viber.

                                Between the two parents, it makes perfect sense why Carlo considers
                                himself to be closer to his dad more than his mom. "He's always been
                                there for me, physically and emotionally, but that doesn't make my mom
                                any less of a hero to me."

                                Danny Estrada, or Carlos dad, earns a living through dentistry. He is 59
                                years old and very much going strong. "He works very hard", Carlo says, "Even 
                                if he's very tired, he will never miss a single day of work."

                                I asked Carlo if he had any special experiences with his father that he'd like to 
                                share. "I remember in High School, we had a father-son activity in one of our 
                                recollections," Carlo fondly remembers, "me and my dad had a one-on-one talk. I don't
                                wanna get into details, but he apologized for his wrongdoings, and so did I."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reflecting on this story, I can't help but compare my High School recollection when
                                we had to do the same one-on-one talk with our parents. Carlo's right, it was one
                                of the best things I've experienced with my parents as well.
